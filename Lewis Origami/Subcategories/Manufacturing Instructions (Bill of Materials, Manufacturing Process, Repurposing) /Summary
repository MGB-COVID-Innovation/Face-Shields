Repurposing 
Alternative film materials such as PETG, acrylic, PU etc. can be considered in case of a PET shortage. However, the center did not evaluate the resistance of these alternative materials to cleaning agents.  
In case anti-fog coating is not available, films without a coating can be used. However, these may result in worse fogging performance.
