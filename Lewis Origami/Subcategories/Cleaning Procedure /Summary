Cleaning Agent Compatibility:

Alcohol-based cleaning agents (e.g. alcohol wipes) with 70% isopropyl alcohol and/or 70% ethanol content can be used  

Bleach-based cleaning agents (e.g. 10% bleach, Virex) can be used, however, these may leave residue  

Cleaning agents may remove anti-fog coating and the fogging properties of the shield can degrade over extended use or re-use
