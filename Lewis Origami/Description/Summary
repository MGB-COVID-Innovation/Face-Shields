In response to the Covid-19 pandemic, the MGB Center for Covid-19 Innovation originated as a collaborative network of four distinct pillars: Devices, Diagnostics, Data Analytics, and Therapeutics. The Lewis Lab Kirigami face shield design was a result of collaboration and interaction between members of the Face Shield working group organized under the Devices Pillar at the MGB Center for Covid-19 Innovation. This group consists of  >400 volunteers, designers, clinicians and manufacturers sharing innovative ideas. Various parts of the Lewis Lab Kirigami design were selected and optimized based on various design options suggested by the community. The design was further iterated and optimized based on user evaluation results. Design reviews were held in a series of Zoom meetings to evaluate and finalize designs.
