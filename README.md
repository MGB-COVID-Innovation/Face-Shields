# Face-Shields

The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a global shortage of PPE for frontline health care workers causing great concern for the safety and health of communities. The MGB Center for COVID-19 Innovation https://covidinnovation.partners.org/ led by Dr. Guillermo Tearney and Dr. David Walt was created in response to the global PPE shortage. The center is organized by four distinct pillars: Devices, Diagnostics, Data Analytics, and Therapeutics. Within each of these groups exisits a collaborative network of volunteers, designers, engineers, clinicians and manufacturers sharing innovative ideas. 

The Face Shield working group is a branch of the Devices Pillar and has upwards of 400 members participating in optimizing and iterating design options suggested by the community. User evaluation results and design reviews were held in a series of Zoom meetings to evaluate and finalize designs.

Face Sheilds can be effective in reducing viral transmission when working among COVID-19 positive patients. They are used to protect user's eyes and face from bodily fluids, liquid splashes, or potentially infectious materials. They are intended for use in conjunction with other appropriate PPE. The use of a face shield does not guarantee complete protection from disease transmission. They are consisdered a Class I medical device. 

Organization: Face Shield designs and downloadable Technical Report PDFs can be found in the "Master Branch" of this repository. All other corresponding design documentation is available through the subcategories under each Design Master Branch.
